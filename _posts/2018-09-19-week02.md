# Wikipedia Controversy

## Thoughts

### Brief Summary
> The article was about a dispute that arose pertaining to if Catalina Cruz (politican) should recieve a Wikipedia page before winning the Democratic Primary. The disagreement between editors lead to the permanent ban of an editor under the name "BrillLyle".

### The Page
> The Wikipedia page for Catalina Cruz was taken down in March because she was not considered notable. When the page was taken down, there was a debate within the community about it and was eventually concluded with the page remaining down until she wins the election or becomes notable. I agree with the takedown of the page because it consistent with the treatment of other politicians under the same circumstances. Wikipedia has only so many resources and if its guidelines are consistently enforced then I don't see any wrongdoing. The page could have definitely aided Catalina Cruz's campaign, but in my opinion the rules shouldn't be bent to favor any candidate.

### The Ban
> The author being banned was definitely warranted because she doxed a Wikipedia editor. The real name of a editor she was having an argument with should not have been leaked even if she felt she was being treated unfairly. Although it is not known if leaking the editor's name was accidental or malicious, there could have been consequences from her actions. 
  
### Notability
> It seems that the guidelines on who could have a Wikipedia page is strict. It would be a good idea to have a page for every candidate as it would give more exposure to lesser known names and informs voters about their stances. I understand the guidelines help raise the quality of the pages and keeps the amount of pages manageable. 

### Note
> The Wikipedia page for Catalina Cruz (Politican) is still currently down, but there is an [everybodywiki](https://en.everybodywiki.com/Catalina_Cruz_(politician))
