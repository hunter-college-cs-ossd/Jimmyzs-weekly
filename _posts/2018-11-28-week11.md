# Bug Triaging

Bug triaging is looking through bug reports and checking its information to make sure it is helpful to developers. It lets the reporter know that the bug report has been looked at and informs them if more information is needed. While looking through Launchpad's bug tracker, I noticed bug reports made every few minutes. Bug triaging reduces the amount of time used to resolve each bug reports by flagging duplicates and ensuring the relevant information is present.

# Choosing the Bug

While looking through all of Launchpad's bug reports, I noticed that it included bug reports for multiple applications. I looked through the reports to find a bug I could try to reproduce and found [Bug # 1805551](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1805551). The user found that when opening two text files from nautilus, the mouse stays as the loading icon. I tried reproducing the bug on Ubuntu 18.04.1 and could not reproduce the bug. I asked the user what version of Ubuntu, he/she is using because it was not listed. It would help narrow down and reproduce the bug if the Ubuntu version and the Nautilus version were known.
