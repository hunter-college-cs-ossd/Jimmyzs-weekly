# Setting Up a Project


## Github Flow

Github Flow is a simplified workflow that allows for frequent deployment and always contains a working master branch. Contributors to projects would fork and clone the master branch and work on a separate branch. Work is done on separate branches to keep the master branch to keep unfinished work from affecting the master branch. Separate branches keep work organized and allows the contributor to jump between issues easily. GitHub flow certainly keeps the master branch stable since contributors do not have direct write access to the repository. The downside is that updates are dependent on the moderators' activity.

## Setting up OpenGenus/Cosmos

Setting up OpenGenus's Cosmos project was very easy. The project was forked and then cloned onto my personal machine. Because Cosmos is a library, it could be used immediately after being cloned. The next step would be finding an issue that my team could take on and add it to the project.
