# OpenStreetMap
 > This week I learned about OpenStreetMap and included my own edits to make the map more accurate. While looking
 > through OpenStreetMap around my area, I noticed that basically everything was blank. There were stores and buildings
 > that were there for decades but have never been added to the map and it seems the satellite images are outdated
 > as well. I added the names of a few places. Some of what I labeled include a Jewish Chapel that is also a funeral home,
 > a T-Mobile store and a recently opened up furniture store.

# Free and Open Source Software Readings
 > This week I read about the history of Open Source Software and the difference between Open Source and Free Software.
 > Richard Stallman was a pioneer in developing and popularizing free and open source software. His three most impactful
 > contributions include building GNU, introducing the idea of copyleft and founding the Free Software Foundation.
 > GNU was the first free and open source operating system, which was a starting point for the free and open source
 > software movement. Copyleft enables free and open source projects to exist because it allows anyone to read, modify
 > and redistribute software. The Free Software Foundation promotes the use and development of free software.
 
 > Eric Raymond had many interesting principles about the development of open source projects. Users are a valuable
 > resource to developers because they are able to give feedback and ideas about how to improve usability.
 > Treating the users as co-developers is useful since there are typically more users than developers. Users are
 > able to spot more bugs and suggest additional features.
 
 > These readings give a description of why free and open source software exists and the benefits of the style.
 > Free software seems to be a way to combat companies collecting and selling user information. Although the idea
 > seems good, it doesn't reach the general public as there aren't many successful free and open source
 > social media platforms.
